# Win32ContentPrepToolGUI

### *_Project is in progress, currently does not work!_*

`Win32ContentPrepToolGUI` is an open source wrapper for the [Win32 Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool) by Microsoft. I wrote this after seeing that there is no clean way of packaging .exe's and .msi's into a .intunewin file.

Written in VisualBasic.NET, `Win32ContentPrepToolGUI` is a Windows Forms Application. This simplifies the process of selecting parameters for the prep tool.
