# Win32ContentPrepToolGUI

### *_Project is in progress!_*

`Win32ContentPrepToolGUI` is an open source wrapper for the [Win32 Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool) by Microsoft. I got tired of having to manually type in file paths without autocompletion, so now we can use a nice GUI to select file paths.

You must download the `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe` executable from the official Microsoft repo before running this application. This is simply a wrapper and requires the executable to pack your apps to `.intunewin` format.

Written in Visual Basic .NET, `Win32ContentPrepToolGUI` is a Windows Forms Application. This simplifies the process of selecting parameters for the prep tool.
